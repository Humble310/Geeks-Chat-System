## Head
Theme (Geeks-Chat) – At the end of your learning path you will have built a WhatsApp-like chat system called ‘Geeks-Chat’ that allows 1 to 1 user messaging (This chat platform is limited to text only messages. Adding other media is a bonus).  

Users must be able to register an account (with a cool Geeky user-handle) on Geeks-Chat 

login.  

Once a user has an account, they must be able to search for other users on the chat-platform, using their handles.  

The user must then be able to start a conversation with another user.  

Once users have had a conversation, they become contacts to each other,  

and their conversations must be stored such that they can always have access to it at a later stage. 

A user must be able to add other users to their contact-list 

The chat platform must allow users to highlight another message in a reply.
